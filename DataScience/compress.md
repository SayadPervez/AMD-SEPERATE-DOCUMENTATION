# compress:-       **`Returns a list if you pass a list. Returns a hybrid if you pass a hybrid`**
#### **`compress()`** is used to remove **_repeated and sequential_** set of data with a single piece of data.
#### **`compress(li)`** is the function header.
#### From version(0.9.2), compress function is compatible with both lists and hybrids.
#### If a list is passed, this function returns a list and if a hybrid is passed, this function returns a hybrid.
#### In the below pic, red colored plot refers to the actual, uncompressed data while blue represents compressed data. As you can see the only purpose of compress is to show the trend of data and since Fit is enabled, an approximation of data is shown. In simple words, **`compress`** replaces continuous equivalent elements by a single element. **`compress`** is used only to visualize how many times a data piece varies to and fro and hence just an approximation. The next pics also has the same color representation as of before and demonstrates **`compress()`** function !
## When lists are used, we observe that the compressed data is approximated.

## When a hybrid is used, we get an accurate representation of data.
